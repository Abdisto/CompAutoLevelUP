# CompAutoLevelUP
Tired of not having the doctrines or skins you want to have in "Company of Heroes II"? The solution is simple. Just make a script fighting against a bot that kills him in 5 minutes with the help of a cheat menue (available on the steam workshop). Or just download this python script to avoid doing your own script.

**Installation**

Test if Python is installed with ```$python``` in your terminal.

U made sure python is installed, then follow these instructions
```
git clone https://github.com/BlacklightYT/CompAutoLevelUP.git
cd CompAutoLevelUP
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
Now the dependencies are installed and you should be able to run this script
```
python Comp_Makro.py
```
If you want to change your current configs just add the ```-r``` flag
```
python Comp_Makro.py -r
```
Now you have to start the script with the required keypress  
Tab inside the Game and enjoy! <3  
For the script to properly work, the Monitor needs to be turned on and comp focused
